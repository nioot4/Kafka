How do I copy files from WSL to Windows?



1. Within the WSL terminal command prompt, navigate to the folder of choice.
2. Within that folder, type and ENTER: explorer.exe . (Donâ€™t forget the dot which indicates current folder)
3. Windows will open a Windows Explorer window for the precise location that you ran the above command, where you can drag-and-drop to-from.
